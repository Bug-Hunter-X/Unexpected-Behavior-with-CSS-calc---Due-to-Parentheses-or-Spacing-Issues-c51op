The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can cause unexpected behavior if parentheses are not properly balanced or if there are spaces between the operators and operands. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px)` is correct, but `width: calc( 100% - 20px )` may not work as expected in all browsers.
